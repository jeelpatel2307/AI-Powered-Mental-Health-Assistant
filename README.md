# AI-Powered Mental Health Assistant

## Overview
The AI-Powered Mental Health Assistant is a Java application designed to analyze user input for sentiment, providing basic mental health insights based on the sentiment of the text. This project uses Stanford CoreNLP to perform natural language processing (NLP) and sentiment analysis.

## Features
- **Sentiment Analysis**: Analyzes user input to determine the sentiment (e.g., positive, negative, neutral).
- **Text Processing**: Tokenizes, splits sentences, tags parts of speech, lemmatizes, parses, and performs sentiment analysis on text.

## Requirements
- Java 8 or higher
- Maven

## Dependencies
This project uses the Stanford CoreNLP library. Add the following dependencies to your `pom.xml`:

```xml
<dependency>
  <groupId>edu.stanford.nlp</groupId>
  <artifactId>stanford-corenlp</artifactId>
  <version>4.4.0</version>
</dependency>
<dependency>
  <groupId>edu.stanford.nlp</groupId>
  <artifactId>stanford-corenlp</artifactId>
  <version>4.4.0</version>
  <classifier>models</classifier>
</dependency>

```

## Setup

1. **Clone the repository**:
    
    ```
    git clone <https://github.com/yourusername/mental-health-assistant.git>
    cd mental-health-assistant
    
    ```
    
2. **Build the project using Maven**:
    
    ```
    mvn clean install
    
    ```
    
3. **Run the application**:
    
    ```
    mvn exec:java -Dexec.mainClass="Main"
    
    ```
    

## Usage

To use the AI-Powered Mental Health Assistant, simply run the application and provide text input. The application will output the sentiment of each sentence in the text.

### Example

Here is an example of how to use the application:

1. **Input**:
    
    ```
    I'm feeling very happy today! But sometimes I feel very sad.
    
    ```
    
2. **Output**:
    
    ```
    I'm feeling very happy today! - Sentiment: Positive
    But sometimes I feel very sad. - Sentiment: Negative
    
    ```
    

## Enhancements

To turn this basic sentiment analysis tool into a comprehensive AI-Powered Mental Health Assistant, consider the following enhancements:

1. **User Interface**: Develop a user-friendly interface (web, mobile, or desktop application) for better user interaction.
2. **Conversation Management**: Implement conversation management to handle ongoing interactions and maintain context.
3. **Advanced Analysis**: Integrate advanced NLP techniques or machine learning models for more accurate and nuanced mental health insights.
4. **Resources and Support**: Provide users with links to mental health resources, coping strategies, and emergency contact information based on the analysis results.
